# KERNEL

A Kernel is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware - most notably memory and CPU time.

There are five types of kernels:
- A micro kernel, which only contains basic functionality;
- A monolithic kernel, which contains many device drivers.
- Hybrid Kernel
- Exo Kernel
- Nano Kernel

A computer user never interacts directly with the kernel. It runs behind the scenes and cannot be seen, except for the text logs that it prints.
